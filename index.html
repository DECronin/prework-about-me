      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a budding software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from the South East of the United States. I have moved quite a bit in my life but Louisiana, Georgia and Florida have been called Home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies mostly revolve around arts like reading, writing, painting, discovering music, however, I also love to learn and organize. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to solve problems and challenge myself to apply my creative drive and abstract thinking into the world with things I can be proud to be a part of.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Central Florida.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because it does challenge me, very much. I always knew I would be in a branch of mathematics, only none of the other hats I had tried on fit the way I needed them to. I took Introduction To Java Programming in my third semester of college and fell in love. I find it can be applied to almost every market in almost any community; breaking down interactions into commands, algorithms, and imputs is a very good description of how I interpreted the world origionally.</p>
